# walletkit-sqlite

Low-level encrypted SQLite support for WalletKit.

The crate provides safe Rust wrappers for connections, statements,
transactions, values, and sqlite3mc cipher operations. On native targets it
builds and statically links sqlite3mc; on WASM it delegates to
`sqlite-wasm-rs`.

It deliberately does not own schemas or storage policy. Those abstractions
belong in `walletkit-db` or in its consumers.
